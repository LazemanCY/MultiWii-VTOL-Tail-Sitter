# Multiwii-VTOL-Tail-Sitter

Modified from MWC 2.4 for Tail Sitter type VTOL drone.

3 fly modes are added: HOV, FFF and PAS.

HOV: Hover mode, uses common quad-copter stick control.

FFF: Fast forward flight mode, change control channel order to fix wing with gyro feedback.

PAS: Pass through mode, no feedback to give quicker control response.
